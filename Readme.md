# Combined Cycle Power Plant: Gradient-Descent
In this Project we are Implementing the Gradient Descent and also using Inbuilt Gradient Descent Regressor on the Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset.

Dataset
-------------------
    The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.
    A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance.
    For comparability with our baseline studies, and to allow 5x2 fold statistical tests be carried out, we provide the data shuffled five times. For each shuffling 2-fold CV is carried out and the resulting 10 measurements are used for statistical testing.

    The training and testing data are provided in the .csv format.

 * **Attribute Information:**
    Features consist of hourly average ambient variables
    - Temperature (T) in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C,
    - Ambient Pressure (AP) in the range 992.89-1033.30 milibar,
    - Relative Humidity (RH) in the range 25.56% to 100.16%
    - Exhaust Vacuum (V) in teh range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg
    - Net hourly electrical energy output (EP) 420.26-495.76 MW

    The averages are taken from various sensors located around the plant that record the ambient variables every second. The variables are given without normalization.


Gradient Descent
-----------------------------
![alt text](https://github.com/abhisngh/Gradient_Descent_Implementation/blob/master/Images/GradientDescent.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model. Parameters refer to coefficients in Linear Regression and weights in neural networks.

Now there are many types of gradient descent algorithms. They can be classified by two methods mainly:

 1. On the basis of data ingestion
 * Full Batch Gradient Descent Algorithm
 * Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm

In full batch gradient descent algorithms, you use whole data at once to compute the gradient, whereas in stochastic you take a sample while computing the gradient.

 2. On the basis of differentiation techniques
 * First order Differentiation
 * Second order Differentiation
